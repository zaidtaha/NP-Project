# NP-Project

In order to run the game locally, open 3 cmd's. On one of them, run the Server java file, and on the other two run the Class java file.
You will first be prompted by the question "are you ready?", answer with "yes" in lowercase.
After that, the games begins. Whoever connected first would begin playing. Each turn you will be shown the cards in your hand and the possible options you can play. Drawing a card is counted as a turn, wild cards do not work. Game ends when a player runs out of cards.
